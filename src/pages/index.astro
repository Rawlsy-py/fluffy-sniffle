					I was originally trained as a Chartered Legal Executive in
					England, working in financial services before switching to a
					career in Software Engineering focused on Machine Learning
					applications for open banking with Street UK Foundation. I
					have experience with Python, including data science packages
					such as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and machine learning with
					Sci-Kit Learn and Tensorflow.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also have experience with full stack web development using
					Javascript tech stacks such as PERN, MERN, and Next.JS to
					build business toolkits such as CRM, lending and
					Micro-finance Software, and customer portals.
